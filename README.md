- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tourelle
- ðŸ‘€ I have a focus towards Groove and Acid Techno and Lo-Fi Music Production, as well as classical and contemporary guitar, with 10+ years of tuition from the Malta School of Music. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working through FL Studio for my productions.
- Here's my Linktree, where you'll be able to find all my productions! I would be more than happy to work with you if you think I would make a good fit for your style of music :)
